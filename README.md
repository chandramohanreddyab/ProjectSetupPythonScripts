# Project Setup Python Scripts 🛠️

A collection of small Python utilities that scaffold common project layouts. These scripts take a target project folder (or project name) as input and create the typical files and directories needed to start a new Python/Flask project quickly.

---

## Features ✅

- Create a ready-to-edit Flask app skeleton (entrypoint, templates, static folder). 
- Add common files: `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, `Procfile` (where applicable).
- Optionally generate test folders and example tests.
- Idempotent: re-running on the same folder will not overwrite existing files unless explicitly requested.

---

## Included script(s)

- `foldersetup_flask_app.py` — Scaffold a Flask app layout with sensible defaults:
  - `app.py` main Flask application
  - `templates/` with base layout and example pages
  - `static/` with CSS
  - `config/` with `config.py`
  - `requirements.txt`, `Procfile`, `runtime.txt` (optional)

(See the script header or `--help` output for up-to-date options.)

---

## Usage

Basic usage (create a folder `MyApp` and scaffold a Flask app inside it):

```bash
python foldersetup_flask_app.py /full/path/to/MyApp
```

Examples:

- Create a new project folder and scaffold files:

```bash
python foldersetup_flask_app.py /full/path/to/MyApp
```

- Force creation inside an existing non-empty folder (use with care):

```bash
python foldersetup_flask_app.py /full/path/to/MyApp --force
```

Notes:

- `project_path` is a required positional argument and should be the full path to the project folder to create.
- The script will exit with an error if the target folder exists and is not empty, unless `--force` is provided.
- The generated scaffold creates a `tests/` folder by default; no separate flag is required for tests.

Run `python foldersetup_flask_app.py --help` for exact flags supported by your local copy of the script.

## Output (example)

A typical Flask scaffold generated by the script will contain:

```
MyApp/
├─ app.py
├─ requirements.txt
├─ Procfile
├─ runtime.txt
├─ config/
│  └─ config.py
├─ templates/
│  ├─ layout.html
│  └─ home.html
├─ static/
│  └─ css/
│     └─ style.css
└─ tests/ (optional)
   └─ test_app.py
```

## Best practices & notes 💡

- Inspect generated files and customize them for your project needs.
- Create a virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt` before running the app.
- Do not commit secrets (API keys, DB credentials) into the scaffold.
